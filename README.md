Guardian Cryptic Crossword Analysis
===================================

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com) has been publishing cryptic
crosswords for well over fifty years.  During that time, there have been a
plethora of different setters, all with their unique style.

Unfortunately, the Guardian only has crosswords going back to the year 1999 on
their website.  So the analysis can only go that far back.

This repository contains JSON files for all the crosswords the Guardian has
hosted.  Because it's scraped from the web, it won't necessarily be as up to
date as it could be -- I'll add this to cronjob on my web server.

You can see [some graphs of this data here](https://www.xteddy.org/gcc-analysis.html)

Patches and ideas for graphs welcome!
